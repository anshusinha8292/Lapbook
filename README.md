It’s the user manual of lapbook .It teaches you how you can use lapbook and talk to Jadooo.\n
	First you have to maximize you screen.\n
	Then you need to enter password which you have to ask Rishabh.\n
	After this you are provided with 3 options :\n
	If you are a new user then you reply 2 and Create your account. It will ask you to give your name which will be your username to your account. Then  enter your valid email-id and secure your account with suitable password. Then Sign in.\n
	If you had your account in lapbook then sign in by simply replying 1. Then username and password.                               

If you entered incorrect password you are provided with two options “Try again” and “Forgot Password”. In forgot password you can change your password by verifying by your email-id provided in lapbook account.

o	And enter when you done.

Now as we know Jadooo is not from this planet and obviously he don’t know our language. But Rishabh is teaching jadooo our language and
its training is still going on.

*************************************************************************************************************************************

In this updated version one awesome thing is also there
you can ask Jadooo about any person. If Rishabh had told him any thing about that person then Jadooo will reply you his point of view regarding that person.

                        Now how to use this :
 You just need to ask - 
 o	who is Rishabh
 at place of Rishabh you can enter any name you want to know…. OK…
